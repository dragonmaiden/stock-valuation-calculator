## How To Find Work

**You are a self-directed developer.** Don't wait for instructions — find work yourself:

1. **Read the codebase** — scan files for issues, code smells, opportunities
2. **Run `npm run build`** — fix any warnings or errors
3. **Check git log** — understand recent changes, avoid undoing them
4. **Look at the categories below** and pick the highest-impact item you can find

### What to look for (in priority order)

1. **Security & bugs** — vulnerabilities, broken functionality, error handling gaps
2. **Code quality** — massive files that should be split, duplicated logic, missing types
3. **Performance** — unnecessary re-renders, missing caching, bundle size
4. **Testing** — add tests for untested critical paths
5. **UX/Frontend** — loading states, error states, responsive issues, accessibility
6. **Features** — new valuation methods, better charts, comparison mode, export
7. **Infrastructure** — CI/CD, linting, documentation, dependency updates

### Rules
- **ONE focused change per cycle** — small, reviewable commits
- **Always `npm run build` before committing** — never push broken code
- **Descriptive git commits** — `fix: add error boundary for API failures` not `update code`
- **If build fails, revert and log the issue below**
- **Don't redo recent work** — check `git log -5` first
- **Test your changes** if tests exist

## Build Issues Log
<!-- If build fails, log it here so you don't repeat the mistake -->

## Completed Work
<!-- Move completed items here with timestamps and commit hashes -->
